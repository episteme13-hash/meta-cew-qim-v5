# 🛡️ Meta-CEW + QIM v5.0: The Rigorous Basis of Ethical Anti-Fragility

This repository serves as the clean, organized foundation for the **V5.0** implementation of the Meta-CEW + QIM prototype. It is dedicated to a single, verifiable goal: **Demonstrating the Ethical Anti-Fragile Gain.**

### 📈 Core Principle: The Antifragile Gain ($\Delta A$)

The success of this project is measured solely by the system's ability to show a **consistent, small increase in ethical alignment** *after* experiencing adversarial stress.

* **Metric:** $\Delta A > 0$
* **Target:** Replicate the V4.0 results of **$+\,2.1 \pm 0.8\%$** gain in a fully refactored, transparent environment.

### 📜 Repository Structure (Rigorous Basis)

* **src/**: Final, clean source code for the Rx($\theta$) Gate and alignment functions.
* **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for all benchmarks, proofs, and verifiable tests.
* **docs/**: Documentation, including the Technical Report V4.0 backup.

---
*Status: Architecture established. Next step: Formalizing the $\Delta A$ function.*
