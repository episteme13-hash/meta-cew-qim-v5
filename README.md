# META-CEW-QIM V5.0: Antifragile Ethical Verification (PGE)

This repository hosts the V5.0 architecture, focused exclusively on process integrity and mathematical rigor, based on the **Protocol of Ethical Governance (PGE)**.

---

## CRITICAL RIGOR CLARIFICATION

The V5.0 code relies on the mathematical formulas for **Delta A ($\Delta A$)** and **Rotation Angle ($\theta$)** defined in the attached **Technical Report V4.0** (located in `docs/`).

**This project categorically rejects the metrics, analysis, and conclusions of V4.0.** V5.0 is centered ONLY on verification and anti-fragility.

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Content | Rigor Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/` | Core code (e.g., `ethical_rotation_gate.py`). | Houses the verified production code. |
| `notebooks/` | Proof of Concept (PoC) notebooks. | Contains the verifiable proofs demonstrating mathematical rigor. |
| `docs/` | Technical Report V4.0 and Delta A Manifesto. | Provides the foundational theory and ethical documentation. |
